It was Ruff Ryders. The next album released by The major rap label was a Chinese solo album, The Rest Is History. True to the album's title, JIN's ambition is clear: just as Big Pun put the Latin world on the rap map, just as Eminem put white people into the rap game, JIN is behind the whole Chinese, the whole Asian hip-hop culture background. He is the face of AsiAn-American hip-hop culture, like Yao Ming playing in the NBA, JIN is the yellow blood of black hip-hop culture in the continental United States.</p>
